    <description>Serial is a podcast from the creators of This American Life, hosted by Sarah Koenig. Serial unfolds one story - a true story - over the course of a whole season.

      <title>Nice White Parents - Ep. 5</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Chana has traced the history of the school from its founding and come to the present. But now: One unexpected last chapter. Last year, the school district for BHS mandated a change in the zoning process to ensure all middle schools would be racially integrated. No longer can white families hoard resources in a few select schools. Black and Latino parents have been demanding this change since the late 1950s. The courts have mandated it. Chana asks: How did this happen? And is this a blueprint for real, systemic change?</p><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/serialpodcast/~4/NzVzMGnkLR4" height="1" width="1" alt="" />

        <![CDATA[<p>Public schools are inequitable because the school systems are maniacally loyal to white families. We can’t have equitable public education unless schools limit the disproportionate power of white parents. But is that even possible? Chana finds two schools that are trying to do just that, and both are actually inside the 293 building. One is downstairs in the basement, where a charter school called Success Academy opened about 7 years ago. The other is upstairs at BHS, the newly renamed SIS.</p><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/serialpodcast/~4/rAgzxY6ICCg" height="1" width="1" alt="" />

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Chana Joffe-Walt explores how white parents can shape a school — even when they aren’t there.</p>
<p>She traces the history of I.S. 293, now the Boerum Hill School for International Studies, from the 1980s through the modern education reforms of the 2000s. In the process, Chana talks to alumni who loved their school and never questioned why it was on the edge of a white neighborhood. To them, it was just where everyone went. But she also speaks to some who watched the school change over the years and questioned whether a local community school board was secretly plotting against 293.</p><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/serialpodcast/~4/xX2quyWxQ7I" height="1" width="1" alt="" />

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>A few days after Hae’s body is found, the detectives get a lead that opens the case up for them. They find Jay at work late one night and bring him down to Homicide. At first, he insists he doesn’t know anything about the murder. But eventually he comes clean. He tells them what happened on January 13th. A few weeks later, he’s back at Homicide and his story has changed. In some ways, these changes are small and understandable. In other ways, they’re big and confounding.<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/serialpodcast/~4/Zwr-2iNgrXk" height="1" width="1" alt="" /></p>

        <![CDATA[<p>It’s February 9, 1999. Hae has been missing for three weeks. A man on his lunch break pulls off a road to pee, and stumbles on her body in a city forest. His odd recounting of the discovery makes Detectives Ritz and MacGillivary suspicious. For instance, why did he walk so far into the woods - 127 feet - to relieve himself? And that’s just the start. A look into the man’s past reveals some bizarre behavior.<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/serialpodcast/~4/zsYOyC2Ljyw" height="1" width="1" alt="" /></p>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Their relationship began like a storybook high-school romance: a prom date, love notes, sneaking off to be alone. But unlike other kids at school, they had to keep their dating secret, because their parents disapproved. Both of them, but especially Adnan, were under special pressure at home, and the stress of that spilled over into their relationship. Eventually Hae broke up with Adnan. And then, depending on who you ask, Adnan was either understandably sad and moping around, or full of rage and plotting to kill her.<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/serialpodcast/~4/8S8WkuVAFY8" height="1" width="1" alt="" /></p>
